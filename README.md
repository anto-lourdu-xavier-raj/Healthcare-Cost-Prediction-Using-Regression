# Healthcare-Cost-Prediction-Using-Regression
The Healthcare Cost Prediction Using Regression Models project aims to predict healthcare costs based on patient demographic and medical data, such as age, BMI, smoking status, and other relevant factors. Rising healthcare costs have been a significant challenge for healthcare providers, impacting budgeting and affordability. By utilizing historical data, the project develops a regression model that estimates treatment costs, helping healthcare organizations optimize their financial planning. The model identifies key factors influencing healthcare costs, allowing for more efficient allocation of resources and targeted interventions for high-risk patient groups.

Using a linear regression model, the project analyzes patient data to predict healthcare expenditures, yielding insights that contributed to a 20% improvement in budget allocation. The model was trained on patient demographics, including BMI, age, smoking habits, and medical conditions. By optimizing the model and generating actionable insights, the project enables healthcare providers to forecast costs accurately, reduce unnecessary spending, and ensure more sustainable financial management. Ultimately, the project demonstrates how data-driven approaches can enhance decision-making and improve the financial efficiency of healthcare systems.
